# Food Spend Tracker

This is a website to mimic a tradition started by a friend of mine and their old group of flats. It all started when one of the flat members was worrying about how much they spend on groceries and food in general. Everyone decided to calculate their food spend and write it up on a small whiteboard to compare and this continued every time they met after that.

So, the core functionality of the website will allow users to submit their food spend on a weekly basis which includes all takeaways and have this display on a leaderboard where it can be compared to everyone else.
